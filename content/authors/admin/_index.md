I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Psychological Methods at the University of Amsterdam, working in the [Bayesian Graphical Modeling Lab](https://bayesiangraphicalmodeling.com/). My research focuses on developing and applying Bayesian methods for analyzing graphical models, with a particular emphasis on cross-sectional psychological data. I am particularly interested in Bayesian hypothesis testing, network psychometrics as well as statistical and mathematical modeling of psychological constructs. On this website, youâ€™ll find details about my publications, current projects, and contact information.
