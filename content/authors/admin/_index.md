I am a PhD. candidate at the Department of Psychological Methods at the University of Amsterdam, working in the [Bayesian Graphical Modeling Lab](https://bayesiangraphicalmodeling.com/). My current project focuses on the further development of Bayesian methods for the analysis of graphical models, mainly for cross-sectional psychological data. My research interests lie in the areas of Bayesian hypothesis testing and network psychometrics. On this website you can find my publications, what I am working on, and my contact information. I am happy to collaborate on research projects, offer consulting, or just engage in stimulating conversations about statistics, science, society, and philosophy in our increasingly complex world.
